Shared guardrail, added after an independent adversarial review found that
code/46 and code/47 silently quadrupled the realized Fisher J relative to
their labeled target_auroc (the exact class of calibration bug Appendix A
already documents finding and fixing once in code/02d's inverted formula).
code/02d had a per-run "calibration_sanity_check_auroc" field, but on
inspection it turned out to be `norm.cdf(sqrt(FISHER_J/2))` recomputed from
the *same* FISHER_J used to build the data -- a tautological restatement of
the analytic target, not an empirical measurement. It would not have caught
this bug class either. This module is the real, non-tautological check.

SCOPE, STATED ACCURATELY (a review found this docstring overclaiming, and
Appendix A already retracts the same sentence in the paper text). An earlier
version of this docstring said "every synthetic generator in this project
must call assert_calibration() before returning data." That was aspirational,
not true, and it is not true now. The only generators that actually call it
are code/46 and code/47 (and therefore code/57, which imports code/47's
harness verbatim). code/02d and its descendants predate this module and are
not gated by it. code/56 deliberately does NOT call it: its anisotropic
generator violates this module's Sigma = I assumption, which is documented
below under "NOT DIRECTLY APPLICABLE". The rule going forward is that any NEW
isotropic synthetic generator should
call assert_calibration() before returning data. Do not read this module as a
project-wide invariant that has already been enforced retroactively.

Deliberately NOT implemented as "fit a classifier and score its CV AUROC":
a standard LogisticRegression's L2 regularization systematically shrinks
the achieved separation relative to the isotropic-Gaussian Bayes-optimal
rate at these dimensions/sample sizes (verified: ~0.04-0.05 AUROC undershoot
at d=64, n=700, consistent across three target AUROCs, far exceeding
seed-to-seed noise). That gap is a real, already-documented property of
this paper's own severity harness (Appendix A's capacity-128 vs.
0.80-ceiling disclosure is the same phenomenon), not a bug -- gating on it
would reject correct generators.

Also deliberately NOT gating in AUROC-space on the realized Fisher J
(tried first): AUROC = Phi(sqrt(J/2)) compresses near the ceiling, so a
single AUROC-space tolerance can't simultaneously (a) tolerate normal
sampling noise in the realized J estimate at low target_auroc and (b)
still catch the bug at high target_auroc, where both buggy and correct J
map to AUROC very close to 1. Verified numerically: at target=0.985 the
bug's realized AUROC deviates from target by only ~0.015, smaller than the
~0.03-0.07 sampling noise band needed to avoid false positives at
target=0.70.

LOAD-BEARING ASSUMPTION, STATED EXPLICITLY (an independent adversarial review
found it undocumented here and in the paper): the finite-sample bias
correction below,

    J_hat = ||mean_pos - mean_neg||^2 - d * (1/n_pos + 1/n_neg),

is exactly right ONLY under identity within-class covariance, Sigma = I. The
subtracted term is the expected inflation of a squared mean-difference from
sampling noise, and it equals d*(1/n_pos + 1/n_neg) only when every dimension
has unit variance and dimensions are uncorrelated. Under a general Sigma the
correct term is trace(Sigma)*(1/n_pos + 1/n_neg), and the target J itself
would have to be the Mahalanobis quantity delta_mu^T Sigma^-1 delta_mu rather
than the plain squared Euclidean norm used here.

CONSEQUENCE, which is stronger than "not yet retrofitted": for an anisotropic
generator such as code/27_anisotropic_covariance_capacity_sweep.py -- which
deliberately fits and reuses the REAL, correlated within-class covariance of
Mistral-7B/HaluEval features -- this guardrail is not merely unused, it is
NOT DIRECTLY APPLICABLE. Calling it there would compare a Euclidean J_hat
against a Mahalanobis target J while subtracting the wrong bias term, so it
could both reject correct data and pass buggy data. Making it applicable to
anisotropic generators requires the trace(Sigma) bias term and a Mahalanobis
target, i.e. a modification, not a call site. Every generator this guardrail
currently gates (code/46, code/47) is isotropic by construction, so the
assumption holds where it is used.

Instead this checks the ratio realized_J / target_J directly, which is
scale-invariant: the bug is a fixed, structural 4x multiplier on J (using
class_sep instead of class_sep/2 doubles the per-dimension mean gap, and
squaring doubles again), independent of target_auroc. Verified numerically
across target_auroc in {0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.985}, 2000 seeds each,
FEAT_DIM=64, N_SAMPLES=700: correct generators realize a ratio in
[0.33, 1.83]; the bug never drops below 2.77 -- clean separation.

Known limitation: at smaller n_samples (code/47's Sweep B goes down to
n_samples=350, i.e. n_pos=n_neg=175), per-dimension sampling noise grows
relative to a low target_auroc's small true J, and the fixed-vs-buggy
ratio distributions start to overlap (verified: at n_samples=350,
target_auroc=0.70, fixed-data ratio can reach 2.32 while buggy-data ratio
can be as low as 2.03 -- no threshold cleanly separates both). Bounds are
set to [0.2, 2.6] to prioritize never rejecting correct data (verified
safe up to n_samples=350) at the cost of reduced sensitivity to a 4x-style
bug specifically in that small-n_val, low-target_auroc regime -- an
inherent SNR limit, not a defect in this check's logic. It still reliably
catches the bug at n_samples>=700, which covers every cell except Sweep B.
