"""
Case Study 2 (GUARDIAN) full 32-layer decomposition.

An earlier version of this paper's Appendix A disclosed this as unavailable
("no per-layer data exists"). That was wrong: GUARDIAN's own sibling project
(`~/Desktop/guardian/results/hidden_states/mistral_7b_tqa_hidden_states.npz`)
contains the full (700, 32, 4096) raw Mistral-7B hidden states -- all 700
samples (the 400-sample CV-selection pool and the 300-sample held-out set),
at every layer, in full dimensionality. This reproduces the paper's already-
published L11 numbers exactly under the paper's ORIGINAL sequential-split
protocol (CV=0.804, held-out=0.616) as a sanity check, then extends the same
computation to all 32 layers.

CORRECTION (independent adversarial review found this): the paper's own
`H[:400]` / `H[400:]` split is a fixed, unrandomized sequential slice of
whatever order the underlying dataset happened to store samples in -- not a
random train/held-out partition. A hidden-state probe can separate the two
halves, i.e. the two halves are systematically different populations, not
exchangeable draws. NOTE (a later review): the "0.734-0.776" range this
docstring previously stated was never computed anywhere in this repository --
it was prose. code/61 now fits the half-membership probe for real and gets an
out-of-fold AUROC of 0.5214 (L0) to 0.7885 (L25), mean 0.7259, above 0.70 at
25 of 32 layers. The halves also differ in LABEL BASE RATE by 8.0 points
(0.7300 vs 0.8100), which is visible directly in the artifact this script
emits and is on its own sufficient to make them separable. See
results/case_study_2_half_membership_probe.json.

SECOND CORRECTION (a subsequent independent review found this): the first
correction's `selection_specific_component()` was itself computed at a
hardcoded layer (11) in every randomized-split rep, not at that rep's own
CV-argmax layer. Since the whole point of "selection-specific" is
gap-at-whatever-layer-the-procedure-would-actually-select minus the mean
gap, hardcoding the layer measures L11's own idiosyncrasy under each
random split, not selection optimism -- silently biasing the result toward
whatever L11 happens to look like, not what argmax-driven selection
actually costs. Fixed: every call site now uses each split's own
`l_star = argmax(cv_auroc)`.

Recomputing the "selection-specific" component of the optimism gap
(gap_at_the_layer_that_would_be_selected - mean_gap_across_all_layers)
under the sequential split (which happens to select L11) gives the
original -0.0038 (no real selection optimism there, an artifact of
comparing two non-exchangeable populations). Reversing the sequential
split (using H[400:] to select and H[:400] as held-out) selects a
different layer and flips sign, itself evidence the sequential-split
number tracks which half is easier, not a stable selection-optimism
estimate. Under randomized stratified splits (each rep's own selected
layer), the corrected result is reported directly -- see the module
docstring is deliberately not pre-stating this number, since it is
exactly what this rerun exists to measure correctly for the first time.

This script now reports, and disclosure-labels, all three: (1) the original
sequential split (kept for continuity with the previously published
numbers, explicitly labeled as protocol-confounded), (2) N_REPS randomized
stratified splits (the corrected primary result, each rep using its own
selected layer), and (3) the reversed sequential split (diagnostic showing
the sign flip).

THIRD CORRECTION (a further independent adversarial review found two things):

(a) N_REPS WAS 8, WITH NO STATED STOPPING RULE. Eight is a small enough
    number that a reader cannot rule out its having been chosen after
    inspecting the result. It is now 50. The binding constraint is not
    runtime (50 reps takes ~15 min on one core) but the size of the shipped
    derived replay artifact, which stores every per-layer, per-sample probe
    score for every rep so code/51 can re-derive the headline number without
    the 171 MB raw hidden-state cache: that artifact grows ~100 KB/rep, and
    50 reps keeps it around 5 MB, which is the largest we were willing to
    put in a submission archive. The RNG stream is unchanged, so reps 0-7
    are bit-identical to the previously reported 8.

    This does NOT fix the deeper statistical problem, which is now disclosed
    in the paper rather than left implicit: all reps resample splits of the
    SAME underlying 700 samples. The SD across reps therefore measures
    split-to-split variability conditional on this one dataset, not sampling
    variability across independent draws from the population, so the
    one-sample t-test's i.i.d. assumption is violated and its p-value is a
    within-dataset robustness statistic, not a population-generalizing
    significance test. More reps tighten the SD estimate; they cannot
    manufacture independent samples that do not exist.

(b) A LIVE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION FOR THE ~ZERO GENERAL GAP WAS UNTESTED.
    The probe here is LogisticRegression at d=4096, n=400, max_iter=1000,
    default C=1.0, on UNSCALED raw hidden states. That configuration could
    plausibly be so heavily regularized toward its prior that both the CV and
    the held-out estimate are dominated by regularization rather than by
    genuine fit -- which would be a different story from "CV and held-out
    estimates are exchangeable under a random split." The `regularization_
    robustness` block below tests this directly: StandardScaler + a sweep of
    C over five decades {0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100}, N_REPS_ROBUST randomized
    splits each, reporting the selection-specific component and the general
    gap at every setting. Convergence is also checked explicitly (max
    `n_iter_` and any ConvergenceWarning) rather than assumed.
