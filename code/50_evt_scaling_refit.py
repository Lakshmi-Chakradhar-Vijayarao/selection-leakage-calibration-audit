"""
honest re-fit of the K-scaling ("winner's curse") relationship
reported in Appendix A's ninth check.

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS. `code/47_selection_multiplicity_sweep.py` fits the
extreme-value-theory (EVT) prediction

    gap  ~=  c * sigma_val * sqrt(2 ln K)

but at lines 230-231 it collapses sigma_val to a single CONSTANT -- the mean
of the per-K-cell `mean_val_auc_std` across all ten K values -- and uses that
constant inside the predictor for every cell. That is not the model the theory
states. The theory's sigma is the noise SD of the validation estimates *in the
cell being predicted*, and this sweep measures exactly that per cell. Using the
constant silently converts a one-parameter EVT model into "gap is proportional
to sqrt(2 ln K)", which is a materially different (and much more flattering)
claim, because the measured per-cell sigma_val varies by ~2.5x across the sweep
AND moves in the OPPOSITE direction from the gap (sigma_val falls from ~0.049
at K=10 to ~0.020 at K=225 while the gap rises from +0.0023 to +0.0052).

This script refits the same data three ways and reports R^2 for each:
  (a) c * sigma_K * sqrt(2 ln K)   -- the "theoretically correct" EVT form,
                                      using each cell's OWN measured sigma_K
  (b) a + b * ln K                 -- two-parameter logarithmic
  (c) a * K^b                      -- two-parameter power law
plus, for reference, the constant-sigma version code/47 actually fit, so the
difference between the two is reproducible rather than asserted.

R^2 is computed as 1 - SS_res/SS_tot against the observed gaps on the same
K>1 cells code/47 fits on (K=1 is excluded there because the gap is identically
zero by construction: selecting the best of one candidate is not a selection).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE EVT "FALSIFICATION" IS RETRACTED AND DOWNGRADED (this revision). A second
independent adversarial review established that fit (a) does not test extreme
value theory at all, because `mean_val_auc_std` IS NOT THE QUANTITY EVT's
sigma REFERS TO.

  What EVT needs.  gap ~ c * sigma * sqrt(2 ln K) is derived for the expected
  maximum of K estimates that are exchangeable draws around a COMMON mean,
  with sigma their SAMPLING-NOISE standard deviation. K independent candidates,
  each estimated with noise sigma.

  What this harness measures.  In code/47, `val_aucs` is one validation AUROC
  per EPOCH of a SINGLE training trajectory, and mean_val_auc_std is
  np.std(val_aucs) over that trajectory. Successive epochs are not
  exchangeable and are not centred on a common mean: they are a LEARNING
  CURVE. Its dispersion is dominated by the systematic rise from
  initialization toward convergence, not by estimation noise around a fixed
  target.

  The two anomalies this script previously reported as evidence AGAINST EVT
  are exactly what that misspecification predicts, mechanically:
    - sigma falls 2.66x as K rises. Of course it does. More epochs means a
      larger fraction of the trajectory is spent converged and flat, so the
      SD of the whole curve shrinks. This is a statement about learning
      curves, not about selection noise, which should if anything be flat.
    - corr(sigma, gap) = -0.84, where EVT needs it POSITIVE. Same cause: the
      gap rises with K because there are more candidates to select over,
      while the trajectory SD falls with K for the reason above. Two
      quantities driven in opposite directions by the same variable will
      anticorrelate regardless of whether EVT holds.

  Therefore fit (a)'s R^2 = -0.399 CANNOT distinguish "EVT is wrong" from
  "sigma is the wrong quantity to test it with", and the previous revision's
  language -- that the extreme-value form is "falsified on this data once fit
  as stated" -- claimed a discrimination the design cannot make. The honest
  verdict is UNTESTABLE_IN_THIS_HARNESS_AS_INSTRUMENTED. Testing EVT properly
  would require a sigma estimated across independent, exchangeable candidate
  evaluations at a fixed point in training -- e.g. K independently-seeded
  models, or repeated resampled validation splits at a fixed epoch -- which
  this harness does not produce. That is a measurement gap, not a theoretical
  obstacle, and it is no longer listed among the obstacles to deriving a
  formal bound.

  WHAT IS UNAFFECTED BY *THAT* RETRACTION. Fit (b), gap = a + b ln K, is a
  purely empirical description of the K axis that never references sigma. It is
  untouched by the sigma misspecification. It is, however, affected by a
  separate and later finding -- see the next block.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DEGENERACY GATE APPLIED TO THE K LAW (this revision; a further independent
adversarial review found this). An earlier round added a bitwise
state_dict-identity degeneracy gate and wired it into code/57's joint
K x operating-point grid, where it caused the K=3 column to be dropped and a
previously-headlined interaction term to be retracted. THE SAME GATE WAS NEVER
APPLIED TO SWEEP A, which is what produces the headline gap = a + b ln K law
this paper quotes in its abstract.

Applying it (code/47 now passes degeneracy_check=True at every call site) shows
Sweep A's small-K cells are largely degenerate by exactly the criterion code/57
already uses: at K = 3, 5, 10 the LEAKY and CLEAN_MATCHED models come out
BITWISE IDENTICAL in roughly 97%, 90% and 65% of (seed, fold) pairs. In such a
cell the measured gap is near-zero by construction -- three to ten full-batch
epochs are too few for the two selection rules to land on different epochs --
not by measurement. Those near-zero points anchor the low-K end of the fit and
therefore manufacture much of its apparent dynamic range and much of its R^2.

Both fits are now reported side by side, and the paper quotes the corrected one:

  log_two_parameter                   -- all K > 1 cells, INCLUDING the
                                         degenerate ones. Labelled contaminated.
                                         This is the previously-quoted fit.
  log_two_parameter_non_degenerate    -- restricted to cells whose
                                         identical_state_dict_frac <=
                                         DEGENERACY_MAX_IDENTICAL_FRAC.

THRESHOLD, AND WHY THIS ONE. DEGENERACY_MAX_IDENTICAL_FRAC = 0.50 is not chosen
here; it is READ FROM code/57, which has shipped it since the joint-surface
correction. Using the paper's own already-published gate keeps the two analyses
consistent and avoids picking a cutoff after seeing which cells it removes. It
also happens to fall in a wide gap in the observed distribution -- the retained
cells sit at 0.36 and below while the excluded ones sit at 0.65 and above -- so
no cell is near the boundary and the partition is insensitive to the exact
value. On Sweep A it retains K in {15, 25, 45, 75, 135, 225}, i.e. exactly the
"K >= 15" restriction, reached by a pre-existing rule rather than by inspection.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ALSO ADDED (same review, a separate and smaller point): Sweep A's ACHIEVED
operating point is not constant across the K sweep even though its NOMINAL
target is fixed at AUROC_0 = 0.80. LEAKY's mean runs from 0.6269 at K=1 to
0.7574 at K=225. Since this paper's own SS5 shows the operating point is a
strong severity modifier, a K law fit across a moving operating point is
partly confounded with it. The fit is therefore ALSO reported restricted to
K >= 10, where the achieved operating point is nearly flat (0.7565-0.7616).
The law survives that restriction essentially unchanged, which is the reason
it is safe to disclose the confound rather than to qualify the result.
