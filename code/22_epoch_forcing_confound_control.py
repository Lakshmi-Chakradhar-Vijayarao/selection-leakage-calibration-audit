fresh-review follow-up on Case Study 3's synthetic reconstruction
(code/02d_corrected_capacity_placebo_sweep.py).

An independent review identified a plausible fourth confound in the
LEAKY-vs-CLEAN_MATCHED comparison that section 4.3 treats as the paper's
decisive test: CLEAN_MATCHED trains on the full tr_idx (matching LEAKY's
budget) but with NO adaptive checkpoint selection during that run --
train_fixed_epochs() blindly trains to a pre-computed epoch count inherited
from an earlier, separate run. LEAKY, by contrast, gets full budget AND an
adaptive best-of-45 checkpoint search against val_idx during the same run.
So the LEAKY-vs-CLEAN_MATCHED gap could reflect "having any adaptive
selection mechanism at all," not "specifically reusing val_idx's real
labels downstream as out-of-fold features."

This script adds a fifth condition, CLEAN_MATCHED_ADAPTIVE, that isolates
this: full tr_idx training budget (matches LEAKY/PLACEBO), WITH ongoing
adaptive checkpoint selection during that same run (matches LEAKY's
selection mechanism exactly), but selecting against es_idx -- the same
disjoint, honestly-held-out fold CLEAN uses -- whose labels are real but
which is discarded after selection, never reused downstream as features.

LEAKY and CLEAN_MATCHED_ADAPTIVE now differ in exactly one respect: whether
the fold used for adaptive checkpoint selection is the same fold later
reused as out-of-fold features (LEAKY) or a disjoint fold that is not
(CLEAN_MATCHED_ADAPTIVE). If LEAKY still beats CLEAN_MATCHED_ADAPTIVE by
roughly the same margin as it beats the original CLEAN_MATCHED, that is
direct evidence the effect is fold-reuse leakage specifically, not merely
"adaptive selection helps." If the gap collapses relative to
CLEAN_MATCHED_ADAPTIVE, the alternative-confound hypothesis is supported
and the original severity estimate is partly an artifact of selection
mechanism, not fold reuse.

CORRECTION (a later independent adversarial review; this revision). THE CONTROL
DESCRIBED ABOVE DID NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS. `es_idx` was carved OUT OF `tr_idx`
via train_test_split(tr_idx, ...), but the arm was then TRAINED ON THE FULL
`tr_idx` -- so every point the "held-out" selection fold contained was inside
that arm's own training set the whole time. Selecting a checkpoint on data the
model is concurrently fitting is not honest selection: in-sample AUROC is
near-monotone in training, so the argmax simply runs to the end of the budget.
The signature is visible in the arm's own kept-checkpoint epoch, which this
script did not previously record: under the broken construction the arm's mean
best epoch is ~38.6 of 45 (near-total convergence), versus ~20.5-20.7 for the
genuinely honest arms. The control therefore measured "train to convergence,"
not "adaptive selection against an honest signal," and could not test the
alternative explanation it was built to test. Any conclusion drawn from it --
including the paper's previous "this alternative is directionally unsupported"
-- was unsupported in turn.

THE FIX mirrors `code/43`'s construction, which already separates these
correctly: there, the arm whose checkpoint is selected on `es_idx` TRAINS ON
`tr2_idx`, the complement of `es_idx` within `tr_idx`, so training data and
selection data are disjoint by construction. CLEAN_MATCHED_ADAPTIVE now does
the same: it trains on `tr2_idx` and selects on `es_idx`. This costs a
disclosed ~15% reduction in training-set size relative to LEAKY
(ES_HOLD_FRACTION=0.15) rather than an exact data-budget match -- the same
trade this paper's other honest-selection arms already make, and the same one
`code/49` documents. An exact budget match and an honest selection signal
cannot both be had within a single fold: the selection points must come from
somewhere.

BOTH ARMS ARE RUN AND BOTH ARE REPORTED. The broken construction is retained
under the explicit name `clean_matched_adaptive_contaminated` so the size of
the artifact is a shipped number rather than an assertion, and so the paper's
correction history is reproducible. `clean_matched_adaptive` now refers to the
corrected, disjoint arm, and is the only one any reported conclusion rests on.
Mean kept-checkpoint epoch is now recorded for every arm (`best_epoch_stats`),
which is the diagnostic that exposes this class of defect directly.
