"""
the reviewer's highest-leverage suggestion: the existing
capacity sweep (code/02d) varies a parameter (MLP hidden width) that
does not actually drive checkpoint-selection winner's-curse severity.
The mechanism is a winner's-curse over K candidate checkpoints, so its
magnitude should scale with K (number of candidates) and n_val
(selection-set size), not capacity. This sweeps the parameters that
actually matter, holding capacity fixed at 128 (the isotropic sweep's
significant cell) throughout, with independently decoupled seeds
(data/split/fold/init -- previously conflated into one `seed` variable,
the root cause of Appendix A's third correction-history issue).

Sweep A -- K (number of candidate checkpoints, i.e. EPOCHS): {1,5,15,45,135}.
  Pre-registered prediction: gap ~ c * sigma_val * sqrt(2*ln(K)), the
  extreme-value-theory scaling for the expected max of K noisy estimates.
  K=1 has no selection at all and must give a gap of ~0 by construction.

Sweep B -- TOTAL SAMPLE SIZE (N_SAMPLES): {350, 700, 2800}.
  RELABELLED (an independent adversarial review found this mislabelled). This
  sweep was previously described, here and in the paper, as an "n_val sweep."
  It is not one. Varying N_SAMPLES moves the train-set size, the test-set size
  AND the per-fold validation-set size simultaneously and proportionally, so
  the resulting gaps cannot be attributed to n_val alone: any comparison
  against the winner's-curse prediction gap ~ 1/sqrt(n_val) is confounded by
  the training set (hence the achievable fit) and the test set (hence the
  granularity and variance of the reported AUROC) moving with it. It is
  reported below as a sample-size sweep, with that confound stated, and the
  paper's extreme-value-theory discussion is qualified accordingly.

Sweep C -- operating point (TARGET_AUROC): {0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.985}.
  The last matches MultiHaluDet's actual reported AUROC (0.9855).

Sweep D -- n_val ISOLATED, via the number of inner CV folds K_CV in
  {2, 3, 5, 10}, at fixed N_SAMPLES=700. This is the sweep Sweep B was
  mislabelled as. Holding the dataset and the outer train/test split fixed and
  varying only K_CV changes the per-fold validation-set size
  (n_val = n_train/K_CV = 280/187/112/56) without touching the total sample,
  the training pool, or the test set the metric is reported on.
  Disclosed residual coupling, inherent to cross-validation rather than to
  this design: the per-fold TRAINING subset size necessarily moves inversely
  (n_tr_fold = n_train - n_val = 280/373/448/504), because a fold's train and
  validation parts partition the same fixed pool. So Sweep D isolates n_val
  from total/test-set size but not from per-fold train size. It is still a
  strictly cleaner test of the 1/sqrt(n_val) prediction than Sweep B, and it
  costs nothing beyond the CV structure the harness already has.

DEGENERACY INSTRUMENTATION (this revision; an independent adversarial review
found the omission). `state_dicts_identical` and the per-cell degeneracy record
below were added in an earlier round and wired into code/57's joint K x
operating-point grid, which gates its fit on them -- but they were NEVER
ENABLED AT THIS SCRIPT'S OWN CALL SITES, even though Sweep A is what produces
the headline `gap = a + b ln K` law. By that same bitwise check the small-K
cells of Sweep A are largely degenerate: at K=3, 5, 10 the LEAKY and
CLEAN_MATCHED models come out bitwise identical in roughly 98%, 90% and 65% of
(seed, fold) pairs respectively, because three to ten full-batch epochs are too
few for the two selection rules to land on different epochs. A cell like that
contributes a gap that is near-zero BY CONSTRUCTION, and feeding it to a
log-linear fit manufactures most of the fit's apparent dynamic range.

`degeneracy_check=True` is now passed at EVERY call site (Sweeps A, B, C and D),
so every cell this script ships carries an auditable degeneracy record. The
check consumes no RNG and does not touch the training path, so every previously
reported gap, arm mean, Wilcoxon p and bootstrap CI reproduces bit for bit; only
new fields are added. code/50 consumes these records and reports the K law both
as originally fit (all K > 1 cells, now labelled contaminated) and refit on the
non-degenerate cells only, using the SAME threshold code/57 already ships
(identical_state_dict_frac <= 0.50).

Everything else -- SweepMLP, the isotropic-Gaussian generative process,
LEAKY/CLEAN/CLEAN_MATCHED/PLACEBO logic -- is an exact port of
code/02d_corrected_capacity_placebo_sweep.py, with the single `seed`
variable decoupled into `data_seed` (which synthetic sample), `split_seed`
(train/test split), `fold_seed` (inner CV fold assignment), and
`init_seed` (torch model initialization).
