"""
the joint severity surface: does a SINGLE empirical model in
(K, AUROC_0) describe the inflation this paper measures?

WHY THIS EXISTS. An independent adversarial review observed that this paper
reports two strong one-at-a-time regularities -- gap rises with the candidate
count K, gap falls sharply with the operating point AUROC_0 -- and never
attempts to combine them, and that a joint function

    E[AUROC_argmax - AUROC(l*)] <= phi(K, n_sel, AUROC_0)

with phi decreasing in n_sel and AUROC_0 would unify the five mechanisms and
turn the checklist into a calculator. The review is right that the paper had
not attempted this. This script attempts it.

WHAT THIS IS, AND EMPHATICALLY IS NOT. This is an EMPIRICAL JOINT FIT
measured inside one synthetic harness, holding the leakage mechanism fixed.
It is NOT a bound, NOT a theorem, and NOT derived from anything. It carries
no guarantee for any cell it was not fit on, no guarantee for any other
mechanism, and no guarantee outside this harness's generative process. A
formally-derived, theoretically-justified upper bound remains future work and
is named as such in the paper's Limitations. Nothing below should be quoted
as "phi".

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GRID CORRECTION (this revision). A SECOND independent adversarial review found
that the previous version of this grid, K in {3, 15, 45, 135}, produced its
headline result -- a significant lnK x z0 interaction, F(1,16)=5.92, p=0.027,
which the paper promoted to the abstract as "the two axes interact
multiplicatively rather than additively" -- ENTIRELY from the K=3 column, and
that the K=3 column is degenerate rather than informative.

The mechanism of the degeneracy. At K=3 only three full-batch epochs occur.
The LEAKY arm argmaxes validation AUROC over those three epochs on the same
fold it later reports on; the CLEAN_MATCHED arm argmaxes over the same three
epochs on a disjoint 15% carve-out and then retrains on the full fold for that
many epochs. With only three candidates, both argmaxes almost always land on
the last epoch, so CLEAN_MATCHED's retrain reproduces LEAKY's optimizer
trajectory step for step and the two models come out BITWISE IDENTICAL. The
"gap" in such a cell is exactly 0.00000 by construction. Two of the twenty
cells in the old grid (3|0.95 and 3|0.985) had gap exactly 0.00000, which is
the signature.

The review's arithmetic, which we reproduced before acting on it: refitting
the interaction model with the K=3 column dropped moves the F-test from
p=0.027 to p=0.378, while dropping ANY OTHER K column leaves it significant
(p=0.043, 0.041, 0.044 for K=15, 45, 135 respectively). The interaction was a
property of the degenerate corner, not of the surface.

Two changes follow.

  (1) THE GRID. K now runs over {15, 45, 135, 405} -- K=3 dropped, and K=405
      added so the axis still has four points and in fact spans a wider range
      than before. AUROC_0 is unchanged.

  (2) A DEGENERACY GATE, run BEFORE any cell is fit. For every cell we compare
      the LEAKY and CLEAN_MATCHED models' state_dict() tensors fold by fold and
      record the fraction that are bitwise identical, the largest absolute
      parameter difference anywhere in the cell, how often each arm's argmax
      lands on the last epoch, and the fraction of seeds whose gap is exactly
      zero. These are written into the output JSON per cell so the degeneracy
      is auditable rather than assumed away, and the fit refuses to run if any
      surviving cell exceeds DEGENERACY_MAX_IDENTICAL_FRAC. The old K=3 column
      is re-run under the same instrumentation and reported separately as
      documentary evidence for why it was dropped, not as a fitted cell.

All five candidate models are refit on the corrected grid and the interaction
test is reported as it comes out. If it does not survive, it does not go in
the paper.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

WHY A NEW GRID RATHER THAN A REFIT OF THE EXISTING SWEEPS. code/47's Sweep A
varies K at a fixed AUROC_0=0.80; its Sweep C varies AUROC_0 at a fixed K=45.
Together they form a CROSS through the (K, AUROC_0) plane, not a grid: there
is no cell in which both coordinates differ from the reference. A joint model
can be fit to a cross, but the fit cannot see -- let alone test -- an
interaction between the two axes, which is exactly the term that decides
whether a single separable function is adequate. So this script runs the
missing cells: a full K x AUROC_0 factorial, using code/47's harness
unchanged (same generative process, same LEAKY/CLEAN_MATCHED contrast, same
decoupled data/split/fold/init seed streams, same guardrail).

GRID: K in {15, 45, 135, 405} x AUROC_0 in {0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 0.95, 0.985},
n=100 seeds/cell, capacity 128, N_SAMPLES=700, K_CV=5 -- so n_val=112 is held
FIXED throughout. This is deliberate and is a stated limitation of the fit:
the review's phi has three arguments and this surface only spans two of them.
code/47's Sweep D varies n_val separately and finds it moves the gap in the
direction OPPOSITE to the winner's-curse prediction, tracking the operating
point instead, so n_val is not an independent third axis in this harness in
the way the theory assumes; folding it in would fit an artifact.

MODELS COMPARED (all least-squares on the 20 cell means, with z0 =
Phi^-1(AUROC_0), the natural monotone transform of the operating point --
it is the coordinate in which the harness's own binormal calibration is
linear, so a linear term in z0 is the parsimonious choice, not a fitted one):
  M0  gap = a                              (intercept only; the null)
  M1  gap = a + b ln K                     (this paper's existing K law)
  M2  gap = a + c z0                       (operating point only)
  M3  gap = a + b ln K + c z0              (additive joint)
  M4  gap = a + b ln K + c z0 + d ln K z0  (joint with interaction)
  M5  gap = exp(a + b ln K + c z0)         (multiplicative/log-linear, fit by
                                            NLS on the raw gaps)
Reported per model: R^2, adjusted R^2, and -- because 20 cells against 4
parameters invites overfitting -- LEAVE-ONE-CELL-OUT predictive R^2, which is
the number that actually says whether the surface generalizes within its own
grid. An F-test compares M4 against M3 for the interaction term.

OUT-OF-SAMPLE CHECK, AND EXACTLY HOW OUT-OF-SAMPLE IT IS. The five Sweep A
cells at K in {5, 10, 25, 75, 225}, AUROC_0=0.80, are NOT in this grid, so
their K values are genuinely held out from the fit and the models are scored
against them without refitting. They are NOT independent draws, though, and
we say so rather than let "out-of-sample" imply more than it is: Sweep A runs
200 seeds using the same seed->stream mapping this grid uses, so seeds 0-99
of every Sweep A cell are the same replicates the grid's cells draw from.
The check therefore tests generalization ACROSS K, which is what it is for,
and not generalization across data. Those five held-out K values are ALSO run
through the degeneracy gate here, and the out-of-sample R^2 is reported both
over all five and over the non-degenerate subset, because a held-out cell that
is itself degenerate is not a test of anything.

INTERNAL CONSISTENCY CHECK. The (K=45, AUROC_0) column of this grid is the
same configuration as code/47's Sweep C and must reproduce it cell for cell;
any divergence means the harness drifted and the run should be discarded.

DETERMINISM UNDER PARALLELISM. Cells are computed in a process pool. Each
cell's BCa bootstrap is seeded from its own (K, AUROC_0) coordinates via
`boot_seed`, rather than from code/47's sequentially-consumed RNG_GLOBAL, so
the output does not depend on the order cells happen to finish in. Every
gap_mean, arm mean, Wilcoxon p and degeneracy statistic is fully determined by
the data/split/fold/init seeds and is identical either way; only resampled CI
endpoints are affected.
