"""
quantifies Case Study 4's winner's-curse severity directly
from data already shipped in code/external/HallucinationPatternDetection/
results/probes/*.json (3 seeds per cell; 33 probed layers for llama3.1-8b
and mistral-7b, 29 for qwen2.5-7b -- see LAYER_COUNTS below). The paper
previously claimed this required re-extracting hidden states from the
quantized checkpoint from scratch; a fresh review found the winner's-curse
estimate is fully computable from files already in this repo.

CORRECTION 1 (an adversarial review found this). The first version of this
script set naive_best_auroc = d["best_auroc"], i.e. the repo's own reported
best -- the max over ALL THREE seeds, INCLUDING the seed later used as the
"held-out" evaluation.

CORRECTION 2 (A SECOND, INDEPENDENT REVIEW FOUND THAT CORRECTION 1 DID NOT
WORK). Rebuilding the estimator as a leave-one-seed-out rotation removed the
stated cause but left the defect itself intact. The rotation estimator is
ALGEBRAICALLY PINNED TO EXACTLY ZERO whenever the selected layer is the same
in all three rotations, which is true in 7 of the 24 cells.

  Proof. Suppose every rotation selects the same layer L. Let a_0, a_1, a_2
  be the three seeds' AUROC at L and S = a_0 + a_1 + a_2, abar = S/3. In
  rotation r the two selection seeds are the ones other than r, so
      naive_r  = (S - a_r) / 2
      honest_r = a_r
      wc_r     = naive_r - honest_r = (S - 3 a_r) / 2 = (3/2)(abar - a_r).
  The cell estimate is the mean over rotations:
      mean_r wc_r = (3/2) * mean_r (abar - a_r) = (3/2)(abar - abar) = 0,
  identically, for ANY data. The per-rotation values are 1.5x the held-out
  seed's deviation from the seed mean -- pure noise that sums to zero by
  construction -- so in these cells the estimator is not measuring a small
  effect, it is measuring nothing at all. The float residues of +-3.70e-17
  seen in two cells are summation-order noise around that algebraic zero, and
  must be treated as exact zeros, not as tiny signed observations.

  This matters because ALL 7 degenerate cells fall in the NON-SATURATED
  subgroup (7 of its 12 cells), which is the subgroup the paper leans on. Its
  previously-reported mean of +0.0065 is 5 genuine measurements averaging
  +0.0157 diluted by 7 algebraic zeros, and its Wilcoxon p moves from 0.047
  to 0.0625 once the two float residues are correctly counted as zeros
  (scipy drops exact zeros; it was ranking +-3.7e-17 as real observations).

THE FIX IS NOT ANOTHER PATCH OF THE SAME STRUCTURE. Three things are done.

  (1) DEGENERACY IS DETECTED AND DECLARED, not hidden. Every cell records
      `selected_layers_across_rotations`, `estimator_degenerate` (all three
      rotations picked the same layer) and a snapped estimate in which any
      |wc| < 1e-12 becomes exactly 0.0. The headline number is computed over
      the 17 NON-DEGENERATE cells, with BCa CI and Wilcoxon; the 7 degenerate
      cells are reported separately and are disclosed in the paper rather
      than averaged in.

  (2) A PERMUTATION NULL characterizes the estimator INCLUDING its
      degeneracy. Note first that a GLOBAL relabelling of seeds leaves this
      estimator exactly invariant -- it already averages over all three
      choices of held-out seed -- so a naive seed-label shuffle is a no-op
      and would produce a meaningless null. The shuffle is therefore applied
      INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH LAYER, which destroys the layer x seed
      structure that makes an argmax stable while preserving every layer's
      marginal set of three AUROC values. Under that null the argmax is
      noise-driven, which is the regime in which a winner's curse is
      LARGEST; the null therefore answers the question the degenerate cells
      cannot: "what would this estimator have reported here if the layer
      ranking had been noise?" A degenerate cell whose null distribution is
      centred well above zero is a cell where the exact zero reflects a
      stable argmax defeating the estimator, NOT an absence of selection
      effect. Reported per cell and pooled, with a permutation p-value.

  (3) A SECOND, STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATOR: the bootstrap estimate of
      the bias of a max-of-means. Resample the 3 seeds with replacement, take
      the argmax layer on the resample, and difference the resample's mean at
      that layer against the FULL-SAMPLE mean at that same layer. It is coarse
      at 3 seeds and is reported as a magnitude cross-check.

      [SUPERSEDED BY CORRECTION 5 BELOW. This point originally read "A SECOND,
      STRUCTURALLY DIFFERENT ESTIMATOR THAT CANNOT BE PINNED ... This never
      telescopes, because the two sides are computed on different seed
      multisets by construction ... reported as a cross-check on SIGN and order
      of magnitude." Nothing telescopes, but the claim that it therefore is not
      sign-constrained was WRONG: see CORRECTION 5.]

Also retained from the previous revision: BCa bootstrap 95% CIs and Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests (this section previously carried neither), and an explicit
ceiling-saturation audit -- many cells sit at AUROC >= 0.975 at every layer,
where there is no room for a selection effect to appear.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CORRECTION 3 (a further independent adversarial review; this revision). THE
PERMUTATION NULL WAS DISCLOSED IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION. Point (2) above was
reported, correctly, for the DEGENERATE cells -- their null sits well above the
non-degenerate cells' observed mean, which supports reading their exact zeros
as estimator failure rather than as absent effect. What was NOT reported is
that the same null is unfavourable in the other direction, and just as plainly:

  * ZERO of the 24 cells reach p < 0.05 against their own permutation null.
  * The NON-DEGENERATE cells' own null mean (+0.0118) also sits ABOVE their
    observed mean (+0.0076), so on this null the observed winner's curse is
    not merely non-significant, it is smaller than what a noise-driven argmax
    would have produced.

Reporting only the half that supported the argument was the defect. Both halves
are now computed for ALL 24 cells and aggregated explicitly
(`permutation_significance_audit`, and per-group null-vs-observed comparisons
inside every `summarize()` record), so neither direction can be read out of the
shipped JSON while the other stays hidden.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT OVERTURN. It does not overturn the algebraic
degeneracy result: the proof in CORRECTION 2 is exact and does not depend on
any null. Nor does it overturn reading the seven exact zeros as estimator
artifacts. What it does overturn is any reading of the non-degenerate cells'
+0.0076 as a statistically established effect. Against the per-layer-shuffle
null it is not one. The honest statement is that this null is a HARD reference:
it puts the estimator in the maximal-winner's-curse regime by destroying the
layer x seed structure that makes an argmax stable, so a real but modest
selection effect measured on a stable argmax is expected to fall below it. That
makes the null informative about the degenerate cells (its original purpose)
and a poor significance test for the rest -- which is a limitation of the
available data (3 seeds per cell), and is now stated as one instead of being
navigated around.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CORRECTION 4 (a third independent adversarial review; SUPERSEDES CORRECTION 2's
SCOPE). CORRECTION 2 proved this rotation estimator is pinned to zero in the
EQUAL-ARGMAX special case. That is the equality case of a much stronger fact:

    THE ROTATION ESTIMATOR IS >= 0 FOR ANY REAL MATRIX WHATSOEVER.

Proof (general). With m(l) the grand mean over seeds at layer l and
f(r,l) = m(l) - a_{r,l}, the rotation criterion is c_r(l) = m(l) + f(r,l)/(R-1)
and the cell estimate reduces to est = (1/(R-1)) * sum_r f(r, L_r), where
L_r = argmax_l c_r(l). Let L* = argmax_l m(l). Optimality of L_r gives
f(r,L_r) >= (R-1)(m(L*) - m(L_r)) + f(r,L*); summing over r and using the
identity sum_r f(r,L*) = 0 leaves sum_r f(r,L_r) >= (R-1) sum_r (m(L*)-m(L_r))
>= 0. QED.  Verified numerically over 300,000 random matrices in code/59
(minimum observed -2.3e-10, i.e. float noise).

CONSEQUENCES, ALL CONCEDED IN THE PAPER (Section 4.4, Appendix B.5):
  * "All 17 non-degenerate cells are positive" is a restatement of the theorem,
    not evidence about hidden-state probes.
  * The Wilcoxon p = 1.5e-5 at n=17 is exactly 2^-16, the arithmetic floor of
    the signed-rank test when every observation shares a sign. It tests a null
    the theorem makes false by construction.
  * `winners_curse_estimate` is therefore DEMOTED to a non-negative DIAGNOSTIC.
    It remains useful for ranking cells, for locating the degeneracy, and as an
    UPPER reference point -- but it is no longer the severity estimate.
  * `bootstrap_max_bias`, computed here as a cross-check, is PROMOTED to the
    primary estimate: +0.0021 over all 24 cells (BCa 95% CI [+0.0013,+0.0037]),
    +0.0028 over the 17 non-degenerate cells, +0.0005 over the 7 degenerate
    ones. It needs no ROTATION-degeneracy exclusion, because equal-argmax
    degeneracy is a property of the rotation estimator and not of the data.
    [The parenthetical "2 of 24 cells NEGATIVE, the property the rotation
    estimator cannot have" is WITHDRAWN by CORRECTION 5 below: those two
    negatives were Monte-Carlo noise, and this estimator is non-negative too.]

TWO FURTHER SENSITIVITIES, both quantified in code/59:
  * TIE-BREAKING. np.argmax resolves ties at the lowest index. 11 of 24 cells
    have at least one rotation with tied maxima, so the "7 of 24 degenerate"
    below is really 6-11 of 24, and the all-24 diagnostic mean ranges over
    [+0.0046, +0.0057] across tie resolutions -- the shipped convention landing
    near the top of that band.
  * 2-SEED vs 3-SEED SELECTION CRITERION. The audited repository selects its
    best_layer on a 3-seed mean; this rotation estimator selects on a 2-seed
    mean, a noisier criterion that incurs a LARGER winner's curse. Calibrated
    cell by cell, the rotation estimate overstates by ~21% on average (range
    18-32%). The bootstrap max-bias estimator resamples 3 seeds and matches the
    repository's criterion, so it is unaffected.

Nothing computed by this script changes. What changes is which of its outputs
the paper reports as the severity estimate. See code/59 and
results/case_study_4_estimator_audit.json.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CORRECTION 5 (a FOURTH independent adversarial review; this revision). THE
PROMOTED ESTIMATOR CARRIES THE SAME DEFECT AS THE ONE IT REPLACED.

The docstring of `_bootstrap_max_bias` used to assert: "Structurally cannot be
pinned to zero: the resample's mean at the resample-selected layer and the
full-sample mean at that same layer are computed on different seed multisets by
construction, so nothing telescopes." Nothing telescopes -- and the conclusion
drawn from that was still false.

    THEOREM 2. Delta_boot := E*[ c*(L*) - mbar(L*) ] >= 0 for ANY input matrix,
    where mbar(l) is the full-sample mean at layer l, c*(l) the bootstrap
    resample mean, and L* = argmax_l c*(l).

    Proof. (i) A uniform bootstrap resample of seed indices is mean-preserving,
    so E*[c*(l)] = mbar(l) for each FIXED l; the max is convex, so by Jensen
    E*[max_l c*(l)] >= max_l mbar(l). (ii) mbar(L*) <= max_l mbar(l) for every
    realized L*, so E*[mbar(L*)] <= max_l mbar(l). Subtracting gives
    Delta_boot >= 0. QED.

    EQUALITY iff both bounds are tight, i.e. (generically) iff the grand-mean
    argmax is BOOTSTRAP-STABLE -- the exact analogue of Delta_wc's equal-argmax
    degeneracy. So the promoted estimator is degenerate too, on its own cells.

WHAT THIS OVERTURNS.
  * "2 of the 24 cells return negative values, which is the property Delta_wc
    structurally cannot have" is WITHDRAWN. Those two cells
    (llama3.1-8b__truthfulqa__linear, qwen2.5-7b__truthfulqa__linear) are
    exactly the two whose grand-mean argmax is bootstrap-stable. Under EXACT
    ENUMERATION of all 3^3 = 27 resamples they are -1.1e-16 and +3.3e-17 --
    float residue around an algebraic zero. The negatives were Monte-Carlo
    noise from the 2,000-draw sampler, not a property of the estimator.
  * "no degeneracy exclusion is needed, since degeneracy is a property of the
    rotation estimator and not of the data" is WITHDRAWN as stated. It is true
    only of EQUAL-ARGMAX degeneracy. This estimator has its own degeneracy set:
    2 of 24 cells under exact enumeration.
  * "those cells do carry a real but smaller effect rather than the exact zero
    the rotation estimator assigns them" is WITHDRAWN for the two cells the two
    estimators agree are degenerate. On the other five rotation-degenerate
    cells the bootstrap value (+0.0005 to +0.0014) is a genuine magnitude.
  * ALL inference from this estimator's SIGN, and its Wilcoxon/signed-rank
    p-value against zero, is WITHDRAWN. Theorem 2 makes that null false by
    construction, exactly as Theorem 1 does for Delta_wc. The point estimate is
    retained as a MAGNITUDE only.

WHAT CHANGED IN THE CODE. `_bootstrap_max_bias` now computes the EXACT value by
enumerating all n_seeds^n_seeds resamples rather than sampling N_BOOT_BIAS of
them. This is cheaper at n_seeds = 3 and removes the Monte-Carlo error that
manufactured the two negative cells. The superseded Monte-Carlo value is
retained as `bootstrap_max_bias_monte_carlo_legacy` so the artifact remains
auditable. See code/70 (exact enumeration + Theorem 2 verification over 50,000
random matrices) and code/71 (calibration against a KNOWN ground truth, which
finds this estimator recovers 0.47-0.55x of the true selection bias, the
"standard" variant 0.28-0.30x, and the retired Delta_wc 1.23-1.34x).
