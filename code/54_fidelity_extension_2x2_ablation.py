aggregate the 2x2 ablation behind the Mechanism-3 fidelity
extension's reported number (Appendix A, issue 10).

Two independent corrections landed on `code/49` at the same time:
  (a) the early-stopping patience, which had been set to the LR scheduler's
      3 instead of the audited repo's own `config.patience = 15`; and
  (b) the calibration transform, replaced with the fully label-free
      axis-noising version (code/43) after the train-only version was found
      to still condition the shrinkage on each point's own label.
Changing two things at once and reporting the joint result would be exactly
the kind of unisolated comparison this paper criticizes elsewhere, so both
were varied factorially, n=100 seeds per cell, everything else identical:

    ES_PATIENCE_OVERRIDE={3,15} x USE_SUPERSEDED_CALIBRATION={1,0}

RERUN under the training-loop fidelity port (Appendix A, issue 14). All four
cells below were regenerated after code/49 was corrected to the audited
repo's learning rate, optimizer, batch size, warmup, scalers, min_lr, grad
clipping and epoch count, so every cell is on the same footing as the number
the paper reports. This rerun RETRACTED a result the previous version of this
ablation supported: under the old full-batch, 10x-too-high-learning-rate
loop, the ES-patience correction shrank the gap at one calibration and grew
it at the other, and the paper cited that sign flip as an independent
instance of its operating-point relationship. Under the ported loop the sign
does not flip -- the patience correction shrinks the gap at both
calibrations, by -0.0029 and by a negligible -0.0004. What the ablation does
still establish is the decomposition it was built for: the calibration fix,
not the patience fix, is what moves this number. This script therefore
reports the patience effect at each calibration and whether the sign flips,
without asserting that it does.

Run (about 4 min/cell on one core):
  for ES in 3 15; do
    USE_SUPERSEDED_CALIBRATION=1 ALPHA_OVERRIDE=0.1328 ES_PATIENCE_OVERRIDE=$ES \
