does the operating-point severity relationship TRANSPORT?

WHY THIS EXISTS. An independent adversarial review pointed out that this paper
promotes a strong operating-point regularity -- severity falls to the floor as
AUROC_0 rises from 0.70 to 0.985, measured in the synthetic Sweep C of
code/47 -- to the abstract, the contributions list, SS5 and the Conclusion,
and at one point framed it as moving severity "more than any difference we
measure between mechanisms." The review then observed that the paper's OWN
shipped JSONs already contain the test of that claim, and that the paper never
performs it.

Three measurements of the SAME contrast (LEAKY minus CLEAN_MATCHED) exist at
achieved LEAKY operating points within 0.003 AUROC of each other:

  * code/47 Sweep C, synthetic isotropic features, target AUROC_0 = 0.95:
    achieved LEAKY 0.9433, gap +0.00065.
  * code/43 real-feature checkpoint-only harness (label-free calibration,
    capacity 128): achieved LEAKY 0.9403, gap +0.0093.
  * code/49 fidelity extension, same real features and same calibration,
    with the LR scheduler and early stopping also coupled to the fold:
    achieved LEAKY 0.9424, gap +0.0250.

  DOCSTRING CORRECTION (a third independent review found this). This block
  previously reported the fidelity extension's gap as +0.0338 -- the
  NON-budget-matched control the executed code below stopped using at code/49's
  sixth correction, and which this paper elsewhere retracts (its sanity ratio
  is 1.60, outside the comparator band, the signature of a degraded control).
  The stale figure also made the docstring internally inconsistent: 0.0338 /
  0.00065 = 52x, not the 38x asserted two paragraphs later. Only the
  budget-matched 0.024984 / 0.00065306 = 38.26x reproduces the shipped number.
  The executed code at the `observations` list below has always used the
  budget-matched key; only this prose was stale. It is now the same number.

If the operating point were the dominant driver of severity that the
operating-point decline suggests, three measurements agreeing to within 0.003
in operating point should agree in gap. They differ by 14x and 38x. Appendix A
already notes that two of these operating points match closely (0.9424 versus
0.9403) but stops there and never takes the next step of comparing predicted
against observed severity.

  WHICH ARM THE 0.0030 MATCH IS ON, stated plainly because it is load-bearing.
  `achieved_operating_point` is a LEAKY quantity in all three rows, so the
  0.0030 agreement is an agreement between the three harnesses' LEAKY arms
  only. Their CONTROL arms agree to 0.0252 and their PLACEBO arms to 0.0412 --
  8.3x and 13.6x worse. Since the reported quantity is LEAKY minus CONTROL,
  matching on LEAKY alone leaves the control spread free to enter the ratio.
  code/82 recomputes this whole check matching on the control arm and on the
  placebo arm instead, and the paper reports all three conventions rather than
  only the one that gives the largest ratio.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES. It takes the Sweep C measurement at the matched
operating point as the "law's" prediction and divides the two real-feature
measurements by it, so the discrepancy is a computed artifact rather than a
claim. It also reports the same comparison against an interpolated Sweep C
prediction at each real harness's exact achieved operating point, fit in the
probit coordinate z0 = Phi^-1(AUROC_0) in which Sweep C is close to
log-linear, so the result cannot be dismissed as an artifact of comparing
against the nearest grid point.

WHAT IT LICENSES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It does NOT show the operating-point
relationship is wrong: within the synthetic harness Sweep C is a clean,
monotone, strongly-fit regularity, and it is reported as such. It shows the
relationship is a property OF THAT HARNESS -- of its isotropic generative
process and its single fixed leakage mechanic -- and does not transport across
harnesses or across mechanisms at a fixed operating point. The claim the paper
is entitled to is therefore the weaker one: the operating point is a strong
severity modifier WITHIN a harness, and must be matched before any two
severity numbers are compared. It is not a general severity law, and the
operating-point decline must not be quoted as one. (A later review also
withdrew the '48.6x' multiplier itself: its denominator is indistinguishable
from zero, so by Fieller's theorem the ratio has no finite confidence
interval -- see code/60. The ratios computed HERE are unaffected: their
denominator is the AUROC_0=0.95 cell, whose gap does exclude zero
(p=0.037).)
